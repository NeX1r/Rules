    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ol class="rule-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Advertising in any form is prohibited.</strong> 
        It is forbidden to promote, hint at, or demonstrate third-party resources, brands, services, servers, channels, groups, products, or projects. This includes direct and indirect mentions, logos, images, videos, voice messages, QR codes, shortened links, status texts, nicknames, avatars, banners, and even "accidental mentions." Even if your content is not clickable or is “blurred” — it is still considered advertising. Attempts to mask or distort links, write them with spaces, screenshots, ASCII art, or use other tricks are violations.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: Permanent ban without warnings.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>NSFW and NSFL content is prohibited.</strong> 
        Any erotic, pornographic, shocking, or disturbing material is prohibited. This includes nudity, sexual content, hentai, gore, dismemberment, suicide, corpses, torture, cruelty, shocking photos/videos, and disturbing sounds. Prohibited formats: text, images, GIFs, videos, voice messages, links, ASCII art, memes, and stickers. Even stylized, "artistic," humorous, or censored depictions are still considered violations.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: Permanent ban.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Spam and flooding are prohibited.</strong> 
        Spam is sending repeated or meaningless content (messages, emojis, characters, mentions, images, sounds, or links) in a short time. Flooding is overloading the chat with massive messages, voice disruptions, loud noises in voice channels, or repeated joins/leaves. "Just testing," "just trolling," or "copy-paste" is still considered spam/flood.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: 1st — mute 30 min; 2nd — mute 1 day; repeat — 7 days ban.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Begging is prohibited.</strong> 
        Requests for money, gifts, items, accounts, services, or donations are prohibited — even if it’s “as a joke” or “ironically.” Asking in statuses, private chats, or disguised as humor is still considered begging.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: Warn → repeat — mute 12h → 3 warns = 7 days ban.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Gambling for money or valuables is prohibited.</strong> 
        Prohibited: bets, lotteries, raffles, casino-style games, or challenges involving real/virtual money, accounts, gift codes, or valuable in-game items. Even "just for fun" raffles with an entry fee are banned.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: Permanent ban.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Sharing personal information and blackmail are prohibited.</strong> 
        Sharing any personal data (yours or someone else’s) is strictly forbidden. This includes names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, IPs, photos, documents, private conversations, and passwords — regardless of whether the data is publicly available elsewhere. Threatening to reveal or use such data counts as blackmail.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: Permanent ban.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Bypassing restrictions is prohibited.</strong> 
        Forbidden: using alternate accounts, borrowed accounts, or technical tricks to avoid bans, mutes, or role restrictions. Attempting to rejoin after being kicked, VPN evasion, or impersonating other members counts as bypassing.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: Permanent ban.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Hate speech or provocation based on discrimination is prohibited.</strong> 
        Insults or mockery based on race, nationality, religion, gender, age, appearance, orientation, profession, disabilities, or other traits are strictly forbidden. This includes direct speech, memes, jokes, "sarcasm," or indirect hints.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: 1st — mute 1 day; 2nd — mute 7 days; repeat — permanent ban.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Unjustified tagging of staff is prohibited.</strong> 
        Staff (admins, mods, developers) may only be tagged in serious cases: technical problems, violations, or real emergencies. Any other tagging (jokes, spam, “just checking”) is forbidden.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: Warn → repeat — mute 12h.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Insulting the administration, developers, or editors is prohibited.</strong> 
        Attempts to humiliate, mock, or discredit the project staff in any form (direct, indirect, hints, memes) are forbidden.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: 1st — mute 3 days; 2nd — 30 days ban; repeat — permanent ban.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Copying someone else’s profile is prohibited.</strong> 
        Using nicknames, avatars, statuses, banners, or other attributes to impersonate another member is forbidden. Even partial copying (similar names with symbols or mirrored avatars) counts as impersonation.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: Mute until profile change → repeat — 7 days ban.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Provoking personal conflicts is prohibited.</strong> 
        Starting or fueling quarrels, personal attacks, insults about private lives, or dragging private conflicts into public spaces is not allowed.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: 1st — mute 12h; 2nd — mute 3 days; repeat — 14 days ban.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Political discussion is prohibited.</strong> 
        Any political topics (parties, figures, events, slogans, or symbols) are not allowed, regardless of whether the mention is positive, negative, neutral, “joking,” or “just sharing news.”
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: Warn → mute 1 day → repeat — 7 days ban.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Insulting relatives and aggressive behavior are prohibited.</strong> 
        Insulting or mocking family, relatives, or close ones, as well as threats, intimidation, or pressure are strictly forbidden.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: 1st — mute 3 days; 2nd — 14 days ban; repeat — permanent ban.</div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Buying, selling, or trading is prohibited.</strong> 
        Any commercial activity is forbidden: buying, selling, exchanging goods, accounts, services, codes, in-game items, or money. Even “friendly exchanges” are still counted as trade.
        <div class="punishment">Punishment: Warn → mute 3 days → repeat — permanent ban.</div>
